    <p><h2> A.W.A.F: Episode 1 — Secrets in the Smoke </h2>


      The studio lights burned red as Charlie King leaned into the microphone, spinning stories of power, morality, and influence to thousands of loyal listeners. His voice was smooth, confident—charming. But tonight, a tiny tremor ran through it, unnoticed by the public, unnoticed by most of his inner circle.

Candice O’Neal’s phone buzzed across the room. A message from an unknown number? No. It was Charlie, or so it seemed: “They’re watching. Not just you.”

She frowned. Something about the phrasing, the timing, felt off. “They?” she muttered under her breath, but she didn’t respond. Instead, she drafted a coded reply, just in case someone else was reading over her shoulder.

Across town, Rachel King stood in the quiet of her home, eyes glued to Charlie’s phone screen. The message wasn’t casual—it was deliberate. A betrayal waiting to explode. Her lips pressed together as she whispered:

"This ends differently than you think."

Somewhere, cameras blinked in darkness, capturing more than just a family quarrel. Someone—or some group—was orchestrating a game none of them fully understood.

Later that night, Rebecca picked up a burner phone and dialed an unknown number. A raspy voice answered: “It begins.”

Her lips curved into a thin, calculating smile. The game had started, and she held the first move.


      
    <h2>A.W.A.F: Episode 2 — The Puppet Strings</h2>



      Rachel didn’t panic. She planned. Every late-night podcast, every secretive text between Chad and Candice, every whispered meeting she wasn’t invited to—she cataloged it all. She had allies—people Charlie thought loyal, people Candice believed invisible. She didn’t need brute force; she needed precision.

That evening, she leaked a carefully edited audio clip of Candice, making it sound like she was plotting behind Charlie’s back. The political machine shuddered. Donors whispered in fear. Followers began to doubt. The movement, their empire, started to wobble on its invisible foundations.

Candice’s phone buzzed: “They’re onto you. And they’re playing for keeps.”

Panic flickered across her face as she realized that someone was rewriting the rules of the game. Charlie? He was blissfully unaware, wrapped up in his charm, ego, and public persona.

Meanwhile, Rachel watched the chaos unfold. She didn’t move too soon. Patience was her weapon. She knew the empire would fracture before her hand even needed to touch it.
