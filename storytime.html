    <p>IAIWAF: Episode 1 — Secrets in the Smoke

The studio lights burned red as Chad King leaned into the microphone, spinning stories of power, morality, and influence to thousands of loyal listeners. His voice was smooth, confident—charming. But tonight, a tiny tremor ran through it, unnoticed by the public, unnoticed by most of his inner circle.

Cynthia O’Neal’s phone buzzed across the room. A message from an unknown number? No. It was Chad, or so it seemed: “They’re watching. Not just you.”

She frowned. Something about the phrasing, the timing, felt off. “They?” she muttered under her breath, but she didn’t respond. Instead, she drafted a coded reply, just in case someone else was reading over her shoulder.

Across town, Rebecca stood in the quiet of her apartment, eyes glued to Chad’s phone screen. The message wasn’t casual—it was deliberate. A betrayal waiting to explode. Her lips pressed together as she whispered:

"This ends differently than you think."

Somewhere, cameras blinked in darkness, capturing more than just a family quarrel. Someone—or some group—was orchestrating a game none of them fully understood.

Later that night, Rebecca picked up a burner phone and dialed an unknown number. A raspy voice answered: “It begins.”

Her lips curved into a thin, calculating smile. The game had started, and she held the first move.

Cliffhanger: Chad laughs on air, oblivious, while a shadowed figure in the corner of the studio silently records every word.
